> Leiningen sucked placidly at a cigar about the size of a corncob and
> for a few seconds gazed without answering at the agitated District
> Commissioner. Then he took the cigar from his lips, and leaned
> slightly forward. With his bristling grey hair, bulky nose, and lucid
> eyes, he had the look of an aging and shabby eagle.
